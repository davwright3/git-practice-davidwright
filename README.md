### What I learned on this assignment
I have admittedly not used Guthub as much as I would have liked previous to this course, but I had enough knowledge to create the new file and clone it onto my PC.

Using text editing and markup in the md files was new to me, and I had always wondered how people were making their readme files look so good on Github.

### Collaboration Experience 
Yulisa was kind enough to help me out by creating a pull request.  
This was my first time accepting a pull request from another user, and it seems to have gone according to plan.

I think I am going to keep working on handling reversions, as that was definitely my weakest understanding on this particular assignment.
