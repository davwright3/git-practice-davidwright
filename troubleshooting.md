This is the troubleshooting file for David Wright, assignment 1 for Modern Software Development.

I have created the files, and accepted a merge request from Yulisa.  All went according to plan.

I then created a conflict by changing the goals.txt file on both the main and feature-addition branches.  
Initially this went well and, I opted to resolve the conflict by deleting both of the additions and adding my own comment in the file.

When I attempted to revert to the file before the conflict, it only took me back to the files where I needed to choose which changes to keep.
At this point, I decided to keep both changes, which added a new line to the original goals.txt file, and it is now ready to be rebranched.
